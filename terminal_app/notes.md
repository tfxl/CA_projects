Objects to consider
1. the app itself
2. the areas of the map (x5)
3. the dot object - will have characteristics. 
4. As such, maybe there will be just a key for main area, rather than an object of area.

So, each dot will have same characteristic classes, but need an 
id
country
action to complete
maybe a progress bar (think, array with |||||| for 10% with a count at end ? len(array)*10 +"%") ?


Player chest - will have basically a single value so does this need to be it's own object, or just part of the app object?
(maybe make it, instantiate it in the app, and then at least it's modularised and can have characteristics applied to class)

Need Rainbow and TTY Prompt - DONE

Will need to use bundler, or create a GEM etc. 

**** CONSIDER NEED FOR ANY INVISIBLE UNICODE CHARACTERS ?? ****
