if key is found, value is given. 




  Score_Template = [{Python:1}, {Ruby:2}, {Bash:4}, {Git}
  
  Iterates the list and if key || key_skill || key_skill etc
  
  or could just do a list of skills; iterate through the list
  
  [python, git, tdd]
  
  iterate through those, and dray out the value dictionary key.value that is in a list
  
  [{python:1}, ]
  
  if iteration[1] == key_skill_of employer than iteration[1][key_skill] => points counter. 
  
  if not a match, store the value in another list. This can then be printed out for the customer to say, hey, have a look at these key values and you can increase your score. 
  
  Iteration stored in (list already matched)
